I work in partnership with my clients to help them discover clarity, purpose and joy in their work. Through thoughtful questioning and guidance, I inspire them to choose courage over comfort and unlock the confidence to perform at their best. Whether you are a member of the c-suite in need of an executive thinking partner or an engineer that has just transitioned to management, my services will be able to support you in your journey.

I hold a [Level 5 ILM](https://www.britishschoolofcoaching.com/qualifications/ilm-level-5-coaching-mentoring/) qualification in coaching and mentoring, as well as being [Dare to Lead](https://brenebrown.com/hubs/dare-to-lead/) and [Leaders Who Coach](https://betterconversations.co/courses-programmes/leaders-who-coach/]) trained.

I currently mentor many founders via the Barclays Eagle Labs scheme, and Codebase Techscaler program. In particular I can help with:
* Your first technical hire into a startup
* Technical vision and implementation
* Hiring and onboarding
* Building a healthy culture in remote teams
* Career coaching for individuals
* Management training for new managers
