There's a lot of chat that if people go into the office they will feel more productive and connected to their colleagues. The trouble is that not every experiences connectedness in the same way, and what works for some doesn't work for others. We should optimise for choice, and letting people work in the best way that maximises their productivity.

Let's imagine I start the day with **10** 'energy eggs' 🥚🥚🥚🥚🥚🥚🥚🥚🥚🥚.

❌ Starting the day irritated and tired by a long commute on a bus with aggressive folk, bad smells and lots of noise: -3 eggs 🥚🥚🥚. 

❌ Becoming exhausted by a noisy office where I'm forced to interact with people all day whether I want to or not: -3 eggs 🥚🥚🥚. 

❌ Being in pain all day from cramps because of my biology and being stuck at my desk or in physical meetings: -4 eggs 🥚🥚🥚🥚. 

Oh look, at the end of the day I'm at **zero** eggs.

That means I have precisely zero energy to dedicate to any of my work tasks and meetings during the day. I'm also too drained to spend time on my hobbies, or home life social interactions.

Contrast this with remote work.

✅ Starting the day with yoga and meditation:  
+3 eggs 🥚🥚🥚.  

✅ Controlling who I interact with and when:  
+2 eggs 🥚🥚.  

✅ Looking after my mind and body by taking breaks when I need it:   
+3 eggs 🥚🥚🥚.  

I've ended the day net positive on eggs, meaning I've got a ton of energy to dedicate to meetings and building relationships with my colleagues 🥚🥚🥚🥚🥚🥚🥚🥚🥚🥚🥚🥚🥚🥚🥚🥚🥚🥚.

And crucially, I have energy in the evenings to spend with my husband and on my hobbies, so I'm ready to take on the world the next day and be at my best.

Not everyone experiences work the same way.

Flexing on conditions and offering remote with an optional office to visit means you can attract diverse range of talent and exponentially increase the productivity of your workforce.
