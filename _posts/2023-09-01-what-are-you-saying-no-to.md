There’s power in unchecked boxes.

As you wind down another work week, it’s important to reflect on what you’ve accomplished, but more importantly, on what you haven’t.

Every unchecked box is a testament to our choices – a reminder that time is finite and prioritization is essential. As leaders, we have to make tough compromises with our time constantly.

While it’s easy to get swept away in ‘busy work’, saying ‘no’ is as powerful as saying ‘yes’. Setting boundaries doesn’t mean you’re not delivering, quite the opposite - it ensures that the doors you choose to open lead to purposeful actions and maximum impact.

So, take 5 minutes to reflect today and praise yourself for understanding your limits and setting boundaries. Recognize that you’re making space for what truly matters by not doing everything.

Think about what you’re going to say no to now, and next week.
