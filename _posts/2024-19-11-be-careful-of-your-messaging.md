Your architecture problem is a people problem. #SpicyTechChat 🌶️

🤦‍♀️ It’s tempting to blame your architecture for all your problem when things go wrong, assuming a rebuild will magically solve it all. 

💡But more often than not team dynamics, communication breakdowns, and decision-making drag hits your cycle time more than your arch.

Before succumbing to second system syndrome ask yourself:

❓ Is component ownership unclear? 
❓ Are teams siloed? 
❓ Do domains misalign with team structures? 
❓ Are there critical skill gaps? 
❓ Do bottlenecks and gatekeeping stifle momentum? 
❓ Is trust low, slowing collaboration? 

Issues like these can destabilise even the most robust architectures and stop their evolution into what you need to drive the business forward.

As leaders, we have to nurture a culture of trust, ownership, and accountability. If you want exceptional architecture, first build a culture that values:

✅ Collaboration 
✅ A unified vision 
✅ Clarity on roles and expectations 
✅ Empowered team members 
✅ Swift, informed decision-making 

Build your culture with intention, and a great architecture will follow. You can't have one without the other.
