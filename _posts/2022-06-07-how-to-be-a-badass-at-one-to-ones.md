One to ones are your most important meetings. No, really.

I've rarely had a line report that when asked 'what does a successful one-to-one look like for you?' (thanks Lara Hogan LINK) could answer based on previous good experiences with managers, which is frankly grim. One to ones are an oddly complex topic that needs to be practised, studied and learned which unfortunately doesn't often happen with new managers.

## What Is The Purpose Of A One-To-One?

 That's a great question and can vary wildly based on the nature of a business. There are certain types of businesses where having the ideal set up for one to ones just isn't possible due to the culture or high paced nature of the business which is, in itself, a problem and a discussion for another day.

 Ideally the purpose of a one-to-one is to create a safe space where you and your line report can talk about what's affecting them at work. This allows you as a manager to ensure that your report feels seen, heard, respected and valued LINK as well as having the correct amount of autonomy, mastery, purpose LINK and sense of belonging to feel motivated.

 When done well it leads to employees with a high level of psychological safety that will call you on your bullshit so that you can make really good decisions about the business and your teams. When done badly it destroys trust, erodes motivation and ultimately leads to retention risk and reduced productivity.

 It can be useful to explicitly state to your line report what your expectations are of one to ones and hear from them what they expect so that you can come to an agreement and be on the same page.

### What A One-To-One Is Not

 A one-to-one is not any of these things:
 * A therapy session. As a line manager you're likely to be woefully under qualified to do any kind of therapy with your line reports be careful not to wander into this territory. Be prepared with signpost to relevant services that may help them such as your companies employee assistance plan and counselling available.
 * A chance for you to push your agenda as a manager and talk the whole time. If you need to disseminate information or get status updates or push something that's on your mind then schedule a different meeting or do it asynchronously.
 * A chance for your line report to ad-hoc reverse coach you on whatever problems might be on your mind. That's for your manager to hold a space for you or for you to find peer support. Reverse coaching can be a powerful tool though and I would encourage you to allow your reports to do this at a separate time and space that you both agree.

## How Often Should You Do One To Ones?

 This again can vary wildly based on the manager and the line report. Personally my ideal cadence for doing one to ones with my line reports is every week for half an hour. This has several advantages:
 * If either party needs a holiday or to cancel for whatever reason the time between one to ones is not too great.
 * The things that are important to someone on a week to week can vary wildly, especially in a chaotic culture, and it ensures I don't miss out on any important insights from their world.
 * If you are a more introverted manager holding a space for someone for half an hour rather than an hour is a lot less energy draining, and the same is true for more introverted reports.

 You may find that people have very specific preferences and they would rather meet every two weeks for example. This is fine and flexibility is important but just make sure it's coming from the right place and they aren't avoiding speaking to you for whatever reason.

## How Should I Structure A One-To-One?

Again this is a big question and varies wildly by manager and organisation. If we go back to the purpose of a one-to-one being a safe space where you and your employee can about things affecting them at work, then rather than thinking about structure we can think about the kinds of things we need to cover to achieve this.

An effective one-to-one has a defined beginning, middle and end that you mindfully guide your line report through. This begins with your opening statement, moves onto exploring the problem space and closes with defining actions and agreeing next steps. I would very much recommend checking out the [GROW model](https://www.performanceconsultants.com/grow-model) of coaching conversations to learn more about this approach.

There may also be times where you have to give constructive feedback to a line report and this will be slightly different to your normal one-to-one structure and is a topic for another day.

### Opening Statement

You will have a strong temptation to open with 'how are you doing?' which on a base human level can seem like a great idea. However it can be an easy way to stray into therapy territory or elicit the cultural response of 'I'm fine' leading to a conversational dead end.

My favourite alternative is to lead with 'what's on your mind?' which has no immediate easy cultural response and gets right to the heart of the matter. I shamelessly stole this from [The Coaching Habit](https://www.wob.com/en-gb/books/bungay-michael-stainer/coaching-habit/9780978440749) which is an absolute must read that will level up your one-to-ones and change your life.

I'm also a fan of leading with some specific praise or acknowledgement as regularly as possible, before moving onto what's on their mind. Giving regular praise as well as constructive feedback is a key component of building trust.

This doesn't mean you should never ask about how their life is - you definitely need to take an active interest in this! And if their home life is top of their agenda they will be sure to share this with you anyway if the psychological safety is there.

### Problem Space
This is where your line report generously and vulnerably offers up information about their life at work. You can act as a thought partner here and guide them through the conversation to new insights, both for them and you.

There's a few rules to follow here:
* Actively listen. Like really, really listen. Your line report should be talking 80% of the time at least. Make sure you have no distractions like checking emails, Slack etc. None. Zero.
* Avoid going into [advice mode](https://blackwells.co.uk/bookshop/product/9781989025758) and stay curious.
* Use the excellent questions from e.g. the coaching habit and get really good at asking the right question at the right time. Get to the nub of what the real challenge is for them and get them to a place of insight and clarity by asking questions and staying curious.

### Agreeing Actions
It's important to hold your line report and yourself accountable. Be sure to reply back what you've heard from your line report so you're both on the same page and design and actions together. These actions should be [STRAM](https://footwearexchange.com/stram-effective-way-to-set-smart-goal/).

Get granular on what support from you looks like and how much or how little direction may be required. Sometimes they will be able to do a task easily without a lot of direction and at other times will need a lot of guidance even as a more experienced employee.

There may also be no actions to agree and that's totally fine.

### What If Nothing Is On Their Mind?

It's perfectly feasible that someone is quite happy or not feeling like they want to be vulnerable with you on a given day. That's totally cool but you're gonna have to be prepared with a backup plan.

It's extremely useful as a manager to have a list of go to questions that really work for you that you can fall back on in a one-to-one situation to elicit information and build trust. For example you might ask:
* What are you most proud of this week?
* What are you most excited to be working on?
* What did you learn last week?
* Which part of your role most frustrates you?
* What's the biggest challenge for you right now?

There's plenty reading out there about potential questions, for example Claire Lew https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2020/02/19/how-to-coach-employees-ask-these-1-on-1-meeting-questions/?utm_source=email&utm_medium=kytnewsletter or Lara Hogan https://larahogan.me/blog/first-one-on-one-questions/ I'd encourage you to have a search and find out what works for you.

## How Do You Build Trust In A One-To-One?

> 'Trust is built in tiny moments' - Brené Brown

One to ones are full of tiny moments where you can either build trust or completely destroy it in a blink of an eye.  When your line report loses trust in you it's game over for psychological safety, meaning that neither party is going to be able to do their jobs at the best of their abilities and your relationship will not be pleasant or authentic.


I'm a big fan of Brené Browns' [BRAVING acronym](https://brenebrown.com/resources/the-braving-inventory/) when it comes to trust so I'm going to frame my take on how to build trust in one-to-ones around that.


### B - Boundaries
> Setting boundaries is making clear what’s okay and what’s not okay, and why

Set a strong boundary around making the most of this precious time with your line report and role model what this looks like to them.

It's absolutely vital that you hold a space for your line report and you are actively listening LINK and fully present. You must never ever and I mean never be on your emails, checking Slack or doing anything else that makes it seem like they don't have your full attention. If you do this you signal to them that their time with you is not important to you and this makes it very unlikely that they will share and they're delicate or vulnerable information with you. You're also saying to them that would be okay for them to act like this in meetings with their reports too.

This is also your time to set what is okay and not okay to share with you. As I mentioned previously a one-to-one with you is not a therapy session and you have to be prepared to set a hard boundary here by calling it out and signposting to relevant services. You want your line reports to be able to be their authentic selves at work, in service to the work and in respect to their colleagues and you. If the way someone is behaving with you in 1:1s is not okay you have to deal with it quickly and briefly.

### Reliability
> You do what you say you’ll do. At work, this means staying aware of your competencies and limitations so you don’t overpromise and are able to deliver on commitments and balance competing priorities.

I mention the importance of agreeing and designing actions together. It's crucial that you follow up on these and if you didn't manage it that's fine but be honest about it and hold yourself accountable for making it right. Very few things will erode trust and faith in you they're not doing what you say you'll do.

Try not to cancel your one-to-ones at the last minute, they are your most important meetings. If you do this regularly it will signal to your line report that you don't value the time with them.

### Accountability
> You own your mistakes, apologize, and make amends

We all make mistakes is part of being brave and trying things and learning new stuff. But we have to admit that and make amends quickly. You can use the one-to-one time with your line report to talk honestly, authentically and respectfully about anything that has gone wrong between you both and make sure it gets nipped in the bud quickly.

### Vault
> You don’t share information or experiences that are not yours to share. I need to know that my confidences are kept, and that you’re not sharing with me any information about other people that should be confidential.

It goes without saying that it's vital that you never share anything told in confidence to you from your line report, with the exception of having to escalate serious matters to HR or your own manager. Even then you should make your line report aware about what you may have to share to who and why.

A related thing that people often don't think about is also not sharing things that other people have told you to your line report in their one-to-one. If you gossip or share things about others you are signalling to your line report that you will do the same thing to them with others and break trust.

### Integrity
> Choosing courage over comfort; choosing what’s right over what’s fun, fast, or easy; and practicing your values, not just professing them.

It's easy to profess to be a great manager but it's very hard to actually _be_ a great manager. The reason being that it takes a lot of work outside of one-to-ones to do one-to-ones well. You will need to do some research about your line report so that you can:

* Regularly give specific praise about things they have done well.
* Regularly offer constructive feedback and support for anything they can improve on.
* Take an interest in what they've been learning, what the challenges have been and what they are proud of.
* Talk about how you have sponsored them and find them growth opportunities.

Remember that constructive feedback is a gift that is in service to your line report and their growth. It's very important that you don't shy away from these kind of conversations - I encourage you to check out Brené Brown's excellent [feedback checklist](https://daretolead.brenebrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/DaringFeedback-EngagedFeedbackChecklist11.pdf) if you need to do give constructive feedback. I also recommend reading [Radical Candor](https://www.wob.com/en-gb/books/kim-scott/radical-candor/9781529038347) by Kim Scott or my [related blog](https://outragedpinkracoon.com/2018/03/18/radically-candid-programming.html) for a summary.

Another important but difficult task is to get on the same page with them about their career aspirations and what they are expecting from you and the company in terms of progression and salary. It's all too easy to lead them along saying you're going to do this and that and they'll get a promotion in X months when you know fine well it's not going to be possible at your company. This is the opposite of acting with integrity and we as managers should be trying to do the best for our line reports even if it means the best thing is for them is to leave the company. What an amazing achievement if they've learned everything they can from us and want to spread their wings.

### Nonjudgment
>I can ask for what I need, and you can ask for what you need. We can talk about how we feel without judgment.

There are going to be plenty of times when your line reports come to you in an emotionally vulnerable state and need you to listen to them. They are allowed to feel what they feel and it's not your place to judge them regardless of how you feel about their struggles. Help them work through it as best you can and show empathy to their situation. I strongly suggest getting clued up on Brené Brown's [empathy misses](https://medium.com/the-ascent/bren%C3%A9-browns-6-empathy-misses-why-they-re-important-54540d5a4f36) to help you with this. Not many things will destroy trust more than 'you think that's bad...'.

It's also important not to over identify with your line report struggles and go on a righteous rage fury on their behalf. Hold a space, stay curious, empathise.

There's also going to be times where your line reports need to give you feedback and it's going to sting and it's going to suck. But you need to listen and stay curious and open about whether there is gold in it for you or not. This is a critical and vulnerable time for your line report who's offering you the gift of feedback hopefully in service to your growth. If it's not in service to your growth and it's not supportive feedback then it becomes a setting boundaries conversation. Either way it's very important that you never lose your cool, you never get defensive or call them a liar and so on because they will never bring you this gift again.

### Generosity
> Extending the most generous interpretation to the intentions, words, and actions of others.

There's going to be times where your line reports do things that you think are wild. There's going to be times where your line reports say things that you just can't believe. There's going to be times when you get feedback about your line reports that doesn't seem right at all. The most important thing is to stay curious and figure out what your most generous interpretation of these behaviours or actions could be, and not jump into judgement. Judgement kills trust.

Learn some tools like [these rumble starters](https://brenebrown.com/art/feedback-toolbox-rumble-language/) from Brené Brown that you can use to ask questions to get information rather than judge.

## Phew, That Was A Lot.

Yeah I know. Management is really hard! If you made it this far congratulations - you are one of the few that really cares about the craft and we need more of you brave souls to spread more joy at work and get people shining brightly rather than being in the shadows of their Tayloristic overlords.
