Most one-to-ones suck. Wanna know why? 🌶️

You talk too much. 😈  
Ouch, I know. Sorry buddy.

Wanna fix it? Here's how. 

Start with an opener that invites curiosity:  
❓ What's on your mind?  
❓ How can I help you ?  
❓ What's the best use of our time today?  

🤐 Then stop talking. I mean it! Yes, you. 

From there, you may do these three things:  
✅ Listen.  
✅ Ask questions.  
✅ Clarify what you heard.  

It *will* feel weird.  
You *will* have a ferocious urge to share your ever so valuable opinions.  
🚨 Don't. 

❌ No anecdotes.  
❌ No advice.  
❌ No opinions.  

💡Instead, breathe. 
❓Ask a question instead.

The more you do this, the more magic you’ll unlock:  
❤️ Deeper trust.  
❤️ Real insight.  
❤️ Actual connection.  

Welcome to not being sh*t at one-to-ones my friend.  
You won't go back, trust me.
