It's surprisingly hard to ask the right question, at the right time to the right person but when you get it right it unlocks doors and ways of thinking you didn't even know were possible.

This is an evolving list of my favourite questions.
## [The Coaching Habit](https://www.waterstones.com/book/coaching-habit/bungay-michael-stainer//9780978440749)

- What's on your mind?
- And what else?
- What's the real challenge here for you?
- What do you want?
- How can I help?
- If you're saying yes to this what are you saying no to?
- What was most useful for you?

## [Dare to Lead](https://www.waterstones.com/book/dare-to-lead/brene-brown/9781785042140)

Okay, some of these are statements to open with rather than questions but it still counts.
- What does support look like?
- What's my part?
- I'm curious about...
- The story I'm telling myself is...
- Tell me more.
- Help me understand...
- What problem are we trying to solve?
- Walk me through...
- Tell me why this doesn't work for you.
- I'm working from these assumptions - what about you?

### TASC - accountability and success checklist
  - Who owns the TASK?
  - Do they have AUTHORITY to be held accountable?
  - Do we agree they have the time/resources/clarity to SUCCEED?
  - Do we have a CHECKLIST of what needs accomplished?

### The 5Cs of Strategic Thinking, Decision Making and Delegation
#### 1. Colour
- What is the intention of this decision or deliverable?
- What is the level of importance?
- What does done look like?

#### 2. Context
- What's happening in other areas that will impact or be impacted by this decision or deliverable?

#### 3. Connective Tissue
- How does this plan/strategy/decision/deliverable solve or amplify what's already happened or happening now?
- Or how does it lay the groundwork for what hasn't happened yet but is part of the future vision?

#### 4. Cost
- What will it cost up to do this in money/time/bandwidth/focus/priority shifts?
- Is this cost tolerable/expected/agreed/controversial/communicated?
- What's the cost of not doing it?

#### 5. Consequence
- What are the consequences of not doing this?
- What's at stake?
- What are the consequences of getting it wrong?
- Are there any unintended consequences we can anticipate or solve for now?
