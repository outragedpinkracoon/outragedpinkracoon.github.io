Hiring is an absolutely critical part of building a successful business and turning away great talent is holding you back from being as innovative, creative and amazing as you can be in your organisation.

If we want to attract diverse people that really match up with what we are looking for in a role, we need to break out of our old patterns of copying and pasting other archaic processes and ideas from others and really get to know what works for us and our organisations.

## Elitist Hiring Says: Barriers Keep Out the Weak

Elitist hiring says you need:
- A first-class honours degree or PhD in computer science.
- X number of years in Y technology.
- an impossible number of technology stacks.
- many other ancillary skills or certifications.

The elitist hiring process wants us to think that this makes any hires to the company 'prestigious' and provides barriers to entry into an exclusive club.

## Compassionate Hiring Says: Everyone is Welcome Here

Putting up barriers like this turns away amazing applicants with unconventional routes into tech. Coding bootcamps allow folk to retrain into tech that already has had other businesses or rich life experiences and breathe so much new life into the industry. Similarly some of the best programmers I've ever worked with have been completely self-taught.

The excellent book ['The Better Allies Approach to Hiring'](https://outragedpinkracoon.github.io/2021/04/26/7-nuggets-from-better-allies-hiring.html) recommends limiting the number of job requirements on an ad to just five. If you only have five to work with, you better make sure everything you ask for is absolutely critical and this is a great way to get clarity on what it is you are actually looking for.

It also recommends encouraging applicants to apply even if they don't meet all the requirements on the job ad by adding text like 'we'd love to hear from you even if you don't meet 100% of the requirements'. A famous Hewlett-Packard study found that women applied for a promotion only when they believed they met 100% of the qualifications listed for a job, while men applied when they could meet 60% of the requirements.

### Challenge Yourself
- List the behaviours and skills you expect to get from asking for a degree.
- Determine what programming knowledge is absolutely essential to the job on day one and can't be taught or grown.
- Figure out what 'good looks like in the current team and nail down these behaviours you are looking for.
- List the behaviours and skills you are looking for from someone with X years in Y technology.

## Elitist Hiring Says: Only Genius Tech Types Are Welcome Here

You don't have to search Indeed long to find a tech job ad that's peppered with gendered and elitist terms such as:
- 'Genius'
- 'Gravitas'
- 'A real technical wizard'
- 'An expert rockstar developer'
- 'Our world class, elite team'

The same ads often refer to the applicant as 'he/him' as well. This is a way to instantly disengage your non-male readers and shout 'you are not welcome here'. Again, if you were to break down these terms into the behaviours and skills you are actually looking for what would they be? What does 'genius' actually mean?

## Compassionate Hiring Says: We Really Care About How We Communicate

We want anyone reading our ads to feel welcomed and included, reducing the chance that they will read something and think 'wow this job is definitely not for me'. It might be tempting to swap between she and he but this is still excluding those that are nonbinary. 'They' is much better and inclusive of nonbinary readers, or simply 'the applicant'.

### Challenge Yourself

- Strip out any reference to a given gender in your job ads.
- Strip out any elitist or gendered terms, you can use many applications to [do this automatically](http://gender-decoder.katmatfield.com/).
- Get someone ideally in your current team from an underrepresented group to read the job ad and give you feedback on it.
- If you have used terms like 'genius' or 'rockstar' remove them and think about what behaviours or skills you actually need.

## Elitist Hiring Says: Longer Processes Mean Better Quality Hires

No one enjoys being greeted with a 10 stage interview process. Most interviews I've done have ranged from 3 hours all the way to 15 hours+. Elitist hiring thinks we are 'weeding out the applicants that won't fit, and making people do lots of tests and trials makes the company a kind of exclusive club. In reality, the more hoops to jump through the less likely you are to find and attract diverse people that really fit your needs.

No amount of process is going to account for when that person joins the team and you really get to know who you have hired.

## Compassionate Hiring Says: Your Time Is Precious To Us

Compassionate hiring says let's do the minimum we need to do to make sure you get your questions answered and we get reasonable confidence that you are a great addition to the team.

Women tend to be the primary caregivers and many other people have critical time commitments outside of work. During the hiring process, they may not only be holding down their current job but looking after others, working a second job and so on. To maximise the chances of not just attracting those with the privilege of time on their hands we need to respect these time commitments of others.

We should avoid the opposite end of the scale where the entire interview is only a 45 min chat with the CTO because the applicant doesn't get time to meet the team or answer their questions about the business.

Be transparent about the process so that applicants know exactly what they are getting into and if they can dedicate the time to it.

### Challenge Yourself
Use your new job requirements list to come up with the lightest possible process that directly addresses these and whether a applicant fits the bill or not. Keep the entire interview process under 3 hours maximum as a general rule. Publish this on your careers page transparently.

Ensure the process gives the applicant exposure to members of the team they will be working with _as early as possible_ so they can get answers to any questions they have and put any concerns to rest before you use it any more of their time.

It's critical that the interview process and the questions are _exactly the same_ for each and every person in the pipeline. This removes as much bias as possible and veering into the territory of off-topic discussions based on the interviewerâ€™s likes and dislikes.
> Use structured interview tactics such as questions focussed on skills and abilities sought after. Ask everyone the same questions in the same order. - Better Allies Approach to Hiring

## Elitist Hiring Says: Code Tests Ensure Quality

Elitist hiring often involves a code test before the applicant even gets to meet a member of the team, often without offering the applicant a chance to explain their work and reasoning. This allegedly vets out those that don't meet a given expected standard and keeps the calibre of the team intact.

There are numerous problems with this.

### 2 Hours is Never 2 Hours
Code tests never take 2 hours, 3 hours or whatever the recommended time is. By the time you set up the testing suite, linter and everything else you need you've easily used up most of that time. applicants are never going to admit your 2-hour tech test took 10 hours so the cycle continues.

As we mentioned before we want to reduce time commitments and anything above 2 hours is an unreasonable ask, and anything under 2 hours probably isn't testing for much.

### Coding is Subjective
There is no One True Path with coding. Coding is more like art than anything else, with lots of different ways to do the same thing that is subject to personal style and preference. Even with fairly clear instructions applicants can submit all sort of wild and wonderful solutions.

The Elitist hiring process wants us to believe that there is The Best Code and that we can objectively assess this without bias but this is not true. The pass/fail criteria can vary wildly based on the tastes of the programmer reviewing the submission.

### You Can't Automate The Human Aspect Away
There are many apps now that promise to find you the best applicants by offering online coding tests, but these often have nothing to do with the day to day requirements of the job. They easily turn away those that could be amazing at the role but are not well versed at these kinds of tests. They also don't allow room for conversation about approach and decision making.

### Coding Is One Aspect Of Being A Programmer
Being a programmer doesn't just involve coding all day, you are often managing stakeholder expectations, mentoring and coaching others, breaking down projects and tasks into manageable chunks, contributing to meetings and processes and a whole host of other activities. Elitist hiring wants us to believe that our worth is determined only by our ability to code yet as business problems become more volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous [VUCA](https://fearlessorganization.com/) we are going to need much more emotionally intelligent people in our teams.

If your hiring process starts with a coding test and not a conversation I'm going to instantly assume you place very little value in emotional skills and 'catalytic' skills (thanks [April Wensel](https://twitter.com/aprilwensel?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor), the skills that make other things happen) and will avoid applying to your company.

## Compassionate Hiring Says: We Want To Get To Know You
Compassionate hiring says we know that great programmers are more than the sum of their coding ability and we want to get to know them during the hiring process.

It's easy to copy and paste code tests and automated tests but this is a sure-fire way to turn away great people. Challenge yourself to ask if you really need a coding test at all.

At my last company, I hired a team of 7 amazing engineers remotely in a pandemic without any of them writing one line of code and we had our most productive year ever in the company. I did this by having structured conversations with the applications around their experience and finding out what would make them happy at work and how they like to work.

Instead of a coding test, we did a lightning talk style presentation for 10 minutes, with 20 mins for 2 of the engineers (of mixed gender/race, very important) to ask questions of the applicant and 15 mins for the applicant to ask them questions. The prep should take no more than an hour or two maximum and we had great feedback on how the applicants enjoyed getting to share their areas of interest with us.

The list of requirements to pass was sent out clearly in advance of the task, such as:
- 'Must be as close to 10 minutes as possible'
- 'We are looking to see how you communicate technical topics in a clear, empathetic and engaging manner. During your work, you will be required to communicate with stakeholders, give presentations and work closely with other programmers so these skills are of high importance to us'.
- 'Must be a topic relevant to the day to day in the role. For example, we use React and Ruby, past talks have included 'Testing with Cypress JS' and 'Promises vs Callbacks vs Async Await'.
- 'We will ask you questions about your topic, but don't worry if you don't know the answer. How you handle not knowing is just as important as domain knowledge'.

The reason I loved this was because:
- applicants genuinely enjoyed the task, even those that were introverted.
- The hiring team enjoyed the task and got to learn new and interesting things and didn't require much of their time.
- With a clear set of guidelines for pass/fail we eliminated as much bias as we could and the One True Path mentality.
- It gave a true reflection of what working at the company would really be like.
- The applicant got time to ask questions to the people they would be working with on a daily basis in their team.

### Challenge Yourself
Given the list of requirements for the role, decide what you are gaining from a technical test. What behaviours or attributes are you really testing for and is the code test really answering them? Could a guided, structured conversation, lightning talk or something else assess the same things?

If you must do a coding test, write down the requirements of the test clearly and unambiguously. Some poor examples I have seen of this are:
- 'Code must be robust'
- 'Must use SOLID principlesâ€™
- 'Must have tests'
- 'Code must be clean and use best practices'

This tells the applicant nothing of substance about the approach to the code. Do you want it to be scrappy, but not crappy? Do you want it to be highly performant and able to be added to easily? Take those loose ideas and turn them into really specific concrete things you want to see:
- 'We expect you to use RSpec for testing, but 100% coverage is not required. Happy path tests are enough as a minimum'.
- 'We expect you to use Rubocop and have no linting errors present'.
- 'Please use an object-orientated style of coding and apply SOLID principles where you feel it makes sense, but this is not a requirement to pass'.

Make sure the pass/fail criteria is absolutely as clear and unambiguous as it possibly can be and that more than one person is involved in the assessment of it.

Before you go subbing in a review of a applicantâ€™s Github profile remember that 95% of open source contributors are men (see the Better Allies hiring book for reference) and women and nonbinary folks tend to have a difficult time in that space. It assumes that someone has the time and privilege to be doing that outside of work, so do this with serious caution.

## Elitist Hiring says: We're All Rockstars At Hiring
The elitist school of hiring believes that they can have a set of 'male and pale' interviewers that have never had any training or experience in doing interviews. The company is so elite that everyone should want to work there right, so why do you even need to try. If you've already attracted World Class talent into your Elite Club what is there to worry about?

A lot, it turns out.

As a woman, I've gone through many interviews where I haven't seen another non-male or non-white interviewer. This is instantly alienating and makes me think 'I don't belong here'. Worse a lot of interviewers give no care to put the applicant at ease, making them feel welcome and supported and that they want them to be at their best. I've failed many an interview not because I was wrong for the job because of the interviewers or the process failed to get the best out of me.

This has a real tangible effect on diverse hiring - meeting someone of the same gender, age or race as themselves resulted in a 50% increase in the odds a woman would be hired for a position at Cisco.

Interviewing is not a chance to strut your stuff and feed your ego. It's a time to be kind and supportive of others while they are in an extremely vulnerable position.
## Compassionate Hiring Says: We Pride Ourselves On Our Process

Compassionate hiring says interviewing is a skill and we pride ourselves on the people involved and the process. We think our process is the kindest, welcoming and most fun that it can be and our interviewers are engaged, trained and rewarded for being part of it.

All too often hiring is an afterthought that no one wants to be a part of, a drain on time and energy both for the interviewers and the applicants. It doesn't have to be that way.

Your interview process and the people in it are clear advertisements for your business. If this is at odds with your _real_ culture, then it's costing you great talent. It's crucial that the questions you ask, the way you make people feel and how you engage with applicants is reflective of the way people interact in your company. Interviewing is a two-way street and you need to tell the applicant they belong, are welcome and will be supported in your company.

### Challenge Yourself
- Ensure you have a diverse range of people running interviews to maximise the chance that applicants will see someone that looks like them and be more likely to feel at ease.
- Be mindful of how people are acting in interviews. Check your employees are behaving in a kind and respectful manner with applicants and championing your culture and values.
- Provide support and training for anyone involved in interviews. It's not enough to assume senior people are able to magically be amazing at interviews. Develop a group of people that are interested and engaged with the process that acts as real advertisements for why your company is a great place to work.
- Reward people for being involved in hiring and be sure not to pile this on top of existing workloads as a side thought. Hiring is a core part of the job and needs to be acknowledged as such.

## Summary

Compassionate hiring takes time, energy and effort but will attract amazing and diverse people to your workforce that will help you be creative and push the boundaries of your business.

To maximise our chances of success we need to:
- Remove the barriers to application and make everyone feel welcome.
- Be respectful of the applicant's time and energy and keep our processes as light and kind as possible.
- Ensure our process really checks for what matters to perform the role and we are not just copying and pasting code tests to be elitist.
- Get to know people as a whole human being and allow for great conversations with them.
- Mindfully grow and develop our interviewing teams, keeping them diverse and engaged and able to attract talent to our companies.
