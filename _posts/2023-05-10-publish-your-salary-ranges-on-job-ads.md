I'm not going to even cover the basics of how if you don't publish your salary range, you end up wasting the company's time and the candidate's time by not realising there's a mismatch until you're weeks into a process. If that's you, go sort your life out before reading further.

I often see leaders (aka white males) on LinkedIn commenting that if you publish salary ranges, people 'will always ask for the top amount'.

### Let's talk about why that's BS

There have been many studies on this topic; one large-scale study was [by the National Bureau of Economic Research](https://www.nber.org/papers/w18511) found that women are less likely to negotiate for higher salaries than men and women who did negotiate were still less likely to receive a higher salary than men who negotiated.

Critically, the results showed that when the process did not explicitly mention wages, men were more likely to negotiate than women. However, when the process did explicitly mention wages, the gender gap in negotiation disappeared.

The study by NBER stated various systemic reasons for this behaviour. Women are more likely to:
- Be risk-averse. They may be afraid of asking for too much and being rejected, or they may be afraid of negotiating and coming across as pushy or aggressive.
- Be programmed to be socialised to be agreeable. They may be more likely to accept the first offer, even if it's not the best offer they could get.
- Lack confidence in their abilities. They may believe they deserve to be paid less than men, even if they have the same qualifications and experience.

Men will always ask for more money than women. White women will always ask for more money than people of colour. And the cycle continues. By publishing your salary ranges, you are giving underrepresented people a fairer shot at asking for what they are worth.

And if someone asks for top dollar, so what? Assess them and see if they match that profile. If they don't, that's fine. You learned something about them and their attitude that you wouldn't have had you not published the range. And if that person is a woman or person of colour, give them a freaking medal for being that brave and hire them right now.

### Let's talk about why wage deflation is BS

Another popular tactic instead of publishing salary ranges on job ads is to instead base offers on the candidate's current salary.

[A study by the Economic Policy Institute](https://www.epi.org/publication/what-is-the-gender-pay-gap-and-is-it-real/) found that women in the United States make, on average, 82 cents for every dollar that men make. This gap is even wider for women of colour. The study found that black women make 63 cents and Hispanic women make 54 cents for every dollar white men make.

So guess what, if you use this a guide you're instantly paying people up to 46% less than the white male equivalent from day one and propagating wage deflation. UK tech start ups reportedly have [the worst gender pay gap in Europe](https://www.uktech.news/news/industry-analysis/uk-tech-gender-pay-gap-20230308#:~:text=The%20data%2C%20which%20is%20taken,in%202022%20stood%20at%2014.9%25.), so let's not make that worse.

A candidate's current salary has nothing to do with the role in the company they are applying for. Assess them fairly, benchmark against your current staff to ensure they are not getting a raw deal versus inbound hires and offer appropriately based on their skills.

Publish your salaries. No excuses.
