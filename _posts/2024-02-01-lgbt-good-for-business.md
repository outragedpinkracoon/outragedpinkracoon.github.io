A recent study by Open for Business has revealed that LGBTQ+ inclusion is linked to higher profitability.

ðŸŒˆ Companies at the forefront of LGBTQ+ transparency are 2.3 times more profitable than their counterparts.
ðŸŒˆ A whopping 92% of major companies now view diversity, equity, and inclusion as essential to their operations.
ðŸŒˆ This is driven by the global LGBTQ+ consumer market grownung larger than many of the worldâ€™s large economies.

Who knew diversity was essential for business? ðŸ˜‰

Itâ€™s bittersweet that itâ€™s often economic benefits that pave the way for greater inclusion, but if it catalyzes a shift towards more equitable ways of working, Iâ€™ll take it.

How is your company putting inclusion into practice? Is it? ðŸ™ˆ Iâ€™d love to hear from the trailblazers in the comments.
