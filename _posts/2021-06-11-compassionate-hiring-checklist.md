This is a quick reference guide based on my blog about [how other companies tech hiring processes are costing YOU talent](https://outragedpinkracoon.com/2021/04/27/other-companies-hiring-processes-are-costing-you-talent.html). See how many items your current hiring process meets and use them as a guide if you are reworking it or starting from scratch.

## On The Job Ad
- The requirements asked for are limited to 5 with no 'nice to have' items.
- There is no reference to a degree or X years in Y technology, instead we have listed the behaviours and skills we expect from the candidate.
- There are no programming skills required that could be taught or grown with minimal impact on productivity of the team or the individual.
- We know what good looks like in the current team and have modelled the requirements based on this.
- We have added text that encourages anyone to apply even if they donâ€™t meet the full list of skills OR they have had a career break.
- There is no reference to a given gender in the content.
- There are no elitist or gendered terms, we have used [a gender decoder](http://gender-decoder.katmatfield.com/) to verify this. They have been replaced with skills and behaviours needed.
- Someone from an underrepresented group has read the job ad and given feedback on it and has been rewarded and acknowledged for spending time on it.

## Defining The Process

- We have used the requirements list from the job ad to come up with the lightest possible process that directly addresses whether a candidate meets them or not.
- We have challenged ourselves to ask whether a coding test is assessing what we need and discussed compassionate alternatives we could use instead.
- If there is a code test the pass/fail criteria is as clear as it possibly can be and more than one person is involved in the assessment of it.
- The entire interview process is under 4 hours (as a guide) including any tests and preparation for them.
- The interview process is published on our careers page and/or job ads transparently and explain how each step relates to the day to day of the role and what we are looking for.
- Applicants are exposed to members of the team they will be working with as early as possible and given time to get answers to any questions they have.
- The interview process and the questions are exactly the same for each person in the pipeline.

## Running Interviews
- A diverse range of people run interviews to maximise the chance that applicants will see someone that looks like them and be more likely to feel at ease.
- We are mindful of how people are acting in interviews and check those involved are behaving in a kind and respectful manner with applicants and championing our culture and values.
- We provide support and training for anyone involved in interviews.
- We reward people for being involved in hiring and create space for those involved to do it well.
