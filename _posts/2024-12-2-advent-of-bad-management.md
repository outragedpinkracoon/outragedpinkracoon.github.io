🎄You've heard of Advent of Code... now it's time for Advent of Bad Management! Are you in??🎄

Mrs Claus has finally had enough and hired you as Santa's executive consultant to help Santa dodge the naughty list. What she doesn't know, is you're really The Grinch in disguise and would love nothing more than Christmas to be cancelled.

🔔 Starting every weekday from Dec 2nd until the 20th, I'll be posting chaotic scenarios that follow Santa as he jingles his way through some seriously questionable leadership choices.

🎅 How to Play:
1. Vote on what you think is Santa's worst idea.
2. Explain to him why it's definitely a good idea with no downsides
3. OR explain an even worse idea he can do instead, and why it's definitely a great alternative.

In a very scientific manner I'll pick my favourite response every day based on what makes me laugh the most. I'll tag the winner in the comments, who wins our everlasting respect. A truly priceless gift! 🎁

🛷 Ready to validate Santa's poor management decisions?

## Scenario 1

🎅: "Ugh, it’s only Day 1 and everything's already gone to hell," Santa thought as he watched elves frantically produce random amounts of toys. "How hard is it to follow a quota? Oh wait, I forgot to give them one… well they should know what to do by now!"

## Scenario 2
🎅: After the fiasco with missing quotas, Santa sighed deeply. "Alright, if they can’t figure it out, I'll just do it myself," he muttered, deciding that the only way forward was to loom over every elf and tell them how to hold a paintbrush. "What do I even pay you for?"
