## Disclaimer
I understand that the coaching services I will be receiving from my Coach are not offered as a substitute for professional mental health care or medical care and are not intended to diagnose, treat or cure any mental health or medical conditions. I also understand that my Coach is not acting as a mental health counsellor or a medical professional.

For legal purposes, I understand that coaching is currently an unregulated industry and that my Coach and their business are not ‘licensed’ by any UK body, even though the sessions may take place in the UK.

I understand and agree that I am fully responsible for my wellbeing, choices and decisions during and after my coaching sessions.

I understand that coaching is not a substitute for counselling, psychotherapy, psychoanalysis, mental health care or substance abuse treatment, and I will not use it in place of any form of therapy.

I understand that all comments and ideas offered by my Coach are solely to aid me in achieving the defined goals I create with my Coach. I can give my informed consent, and hereby give such consent to my Coach to assist me in achieving such goals and I understand that results are not guaranteed.

I understand that where our work together involves career or business, my Coach is not promising or guaranteeing outcomes including (but not limited to) increased clientele, profitability and/or business success.

I understand that my Coach will protect my information as confidential unless I state otherwise in writing.

I understand that the use of technology is not always secure and I accept the risks of confidentiality in the use of email, text, phone, Google Meet and other technology.

## Terms and conditions
### Description
Coaching is a partnership (defined as an alliance, not a legal business partnership) between the Coach and the Client. It is a thought-provoking and creative process that aims to inspire the client to maximise personal and professional potential.

Coaching is a collaborative conversation that aims to help you, the Client, to gain clarity and insights. It is focused purely on your agenda. Coaching helps you discover the right way to progress, and, by asking questions of you, helps you to find the right answers and to take actions. Coaching is supportive and non-judgmental. You enter into coaching with the understanding that you are responsible for creating your own results.

### Responsibilities
The Client is responsible for creating and implementing their physical, mental and emotional wellbeing, decisions, choices, actions and results. As such, the Client agrees that the Coach is not and will not be liable for any actions or inaction, or any direct or indirect result of any services provided by the Coach. The Client understands that coaching is not therapy, does not substitute for any therapy needed, and does not prevent, cure, or treat any mental disorder or medical disease.

The Client understands that coaching is not to be used as a substitute for professional advice by legal, mental, medical or other qualified professionals and will seek independent professional guidance for such matters.

The Client agrees to communicate honestly, be open to feedback and assistance and create the time and energy to participate fully in the sessions.

### Services
The coaching sessions will be arranged flexibly between the Coach and the Client and each session can be booked up to a month in advance by email or text.  The Coach may recommend the frequency of coaching sessions based on a professional assessment of the Client’s requirements. This recommendation, or plan, is not binding and may be altered and adjusted throughout the coaching journey by mutual agreement, following the terms set out in this agreement.

Where a Client is unhappy with or unsure of any of the terms and conditions in this agreement, they can contact the Coach to discuss any concerns and see if they can be resolved before the first coaching session. Participation by any individual in the first coaching session constitutes acceptance of these terms and conditions.

### Fees
The fee price for the Client’s coaching sessions will be £75.00 per session.

In return for the fees payable by the Client (or by a third party on their behalf), the Coach agrees to provide the service as described in this agreement and accordance with the terms and conditions set out in this agreement. The Client agrees to pay fees for the service on the terms and conditions set out in this agreement (in situations where a third party pays the fees, the third party counts as an agent acting on behalf of the Client).

### Procedure
The time and date of the coaching meetings will be determined by the Coach and Client based on a mutually agreed time and will take place virtually. The Client will be sent a calendar invite with a Google Meet or Zoom link to join for the coaching session video call.

### Confidentiality
This coaching relationship and all information (documented or verbal) that the Client shares with the Coach as part of this relationship will be treated as confidential but is not considered a legally confidential relationship (like in Medicine or Law). The Coach agrees not to disclose any information about the Client without the Client’s written consent. The Coach will not disclose the Client’s name as a reference without the Client’s consent. Confidential information does not include information that: (a) was in the Coach’s possession before its being furnished by the Client; (b) is generally known to the public or in the Client’s industry; (c) is obtained by the Coach from a third party, without breach of any obligation to the Client; (d) is independently developed by the Coach without the use of or reference to the Client’s confidential information; or (e) that the Coach is required by law to disclose.

According to the ethics of our profession, topics may be anonymously and hypothetically shared with other coaching professionals for training, supervision, mentoring, evaluation, and further coach professional development and/or consultation purposes.

### Cancellation and lateness
The Client agrees that it is the Client’s responsibility to notify the Coach by text or email at least 48 hours in advance of the scheduled meeting if the client cannot attend the session.  The Client will be billed in full for a missed session if the client does not turn up or hasn't rescheduled following the cancellation and lateness policy defined in this agreement. The Coach will wait in the session for 15 minutes before the Client is noted as not turning up. Exceptions will be made for any situations arising that are out of the Client’s control, such as losing internet connection or a family emergency. Should a session be booked for less than 48 hours in advance then be cancelled the session fee would still be payable.

### Payment terms
Invoices will be sent to the Client by email after each session, payable via the payment options given in the invoice within a month of issue, with a charge levied for late payment. Where more than one session has been agreed upon in a month, payment for delivered services will be grouped together and sent out on the last day of the month.

### Refunds
Refunds are not available since invoices are sent after sessions have completed.

### Termination
Either the Client or the Coach may terminate this agreement at any time.

In certain circumstances, such as illness or unavailability due to bereavement or other commitments, inappropriate behaviour by the Client, an actual or potential conflict of interest, or other reasons, the Coach can decide to terminate the service to the Client early. In such circumstances, the client will be given reasonable notice of termination by the Coach where practicable.

### Variation of terms and conditions
The Coach may change any of these terms or conditions including the Per Session Fee by giving the client one week’s notice in writing by email of the change(s). If following receipt of such notification of the change(s), the Client no longer wishes to proceed with further coaching sessions, the Client may withdraw from the service immediately by giving notice by email. Should a session be booked for less than 48 hours in advance and be subject to such a change, the session fee would not be payable in this instance.

### Limited liability
Except as expressly provided in this agreement, the Coach makes no guarantees or warranties, express or implied. In no event will the Coach be liable to the Client for consequential or special damages. Notwithstanding any damages that the Client may incur, the Coach’s entire liability under this agreement, and the Client’s exclusive remedy, will be limited to the amount paid by the Client to the Coach under this agreement for all services rendered up until the termination date.

### Governing law

This agreement is governed by the law of Scotland whose courts have exclusive jurisdiction about any dispute, disagreement, proceedings or legal claim of any nature relating to the service provided or the contract.

This is the parties’ entire agreement and reflects a complete understanding of the parties concerning the subject matter. This agreement supersedes all prior written and oral representations.

### Feedback
Feedback about the service is welcomed and can be given during a coaching session or by emailing [coaching@outragedpinkracoon.com](coaching@outragedpinkracoon.com).
