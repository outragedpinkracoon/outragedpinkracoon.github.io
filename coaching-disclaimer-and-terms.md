The coaching disclaimer and terms and conditions outlined below define the relationship between Coach and Client and underpin any services delivered by Valerie Dryden trading as Outraged Racoon Coaching. Please make sure you read the following carefully and if you have any questions or queries then please send them by email to [coaching@outragedpinkracoon.com](coaching@outragedpinkracoon.com).

## Disclaimer

I understand that I am solely responsible for my own physical, mental, and emotional well-being, decisions, choices, actions, and results arising from the coaching relationship. Accordingly, I agree that the Coach is not and will not be liable for any actions, inaction, or direct or indirect results of the services provided.

I acknowledge that coaching is not a substitute for counselling, psychotherapy, psychoanalysis, mental health care, substance abuse treatment, or medical advice, and that the Coach is not acting as a medical professional or mental health counsellor. Coaching does not diagnose, treat, prevent, or cure any mental disorder or medical condition. For legal purposes, I understand that coaching is an unregulated industry and that my Coach and their business are not “licensed” by any UK body.

I understand that coaching is a process designed to support me in achieving the goals I set with my Coach, but that results are not guaranteed. Where our work involves career or business matters, I understand that no promises are made regarding specific outcomes, including (but not limited to) increased clientele, profitability, or business success.

I understand that my Coach will treat my information as confidential, subject to the exceptions set out in this agreement, and that the use of technology (including email, text, phone, and video conferencing) carries inherent risks to confidentiality which I accept.

## Terms and conditions

### Description
Coaching is a partnership (an alliance, not a legal business partnership) between the Coach and the Client. It is a thought-provoking and creative process designed to inspire the Client to maximise personal and professional potential.

Coaching is a collaborative conversation focused entirely on the Client’s agenda. Through questions and reflection, coaching helps the Client gain clarity, discover their own answers, and take meaningful action. The process is supportive, challenging where needed, and non-judgmental.

Coaching may explore different areas of the Client’s life, including work, finances, health, relationships, education and recreation. Responsibility for all decisions and actions in these areas rests solely with the Client.

### Responsibilities
The Client is responsible for their own physical, mental, and emotional wellbeing, as well as for all decisions, choices, actions, and results. The Coach is not, and will not be, liable for any actions, inaction, or outcomes arising from the coaching relationship.

The Client understands that coaching is not therapy and does not substitute for counselling, medical, legal, financial, or other professional advice. Where such expertise is required, the Client will seek independent professional guidance.

The Client agrees to communicate honestly, be open to feedback, and commit the necessary time and energy to participate fully in the coaching process.

### Services
Coaching sessions will be arranged flexibly between the Coach and the Client, with each session bookable up to one month in advance by email or text. The Coach may recommend a frequency of sessions based on a professional assessment of the Client’s needs; this recommendation is not binding and may be adjusted by mutual agreement throughout the coaching journey.

Additional sessions may be agreed after completion of the initial arrangement. These terms and conditions will apply to all sessions, and the Per Session Fee will remain as originally agreed unless the Coach notifies the Client in writing of any change, in line with the section headed Variation of Terms and Conditions.

Clients who have concerns about any part of this agreement should raise them with the Coach before the first session. Participation in the first session constitutes acceptance of these terms and conditions.

### Per Session Fee
The fee for coaching is £250.00 (VAT exempt) per 50-minute session. Discounts may be agreed on a discretionary basis for single or block bookings.

In return for the fees payable by the Client (or by a third party acting on the Client’s behalf), the Coach will provide the services described in this agreement, in accordance with its terms and conditions.

### Procedure
Coaching sessions will take place virtually at times mutually agreed between the Coach and the Client. A calendar invitation with a Google Meet link will be provided for each session.

### Confidentiality
All information (documented or verbal) shared by the Client in coaching sessions will be treated as confidential, though the coaching relationship is not a legally privileged relationship (as in medicine or law).

The Coach will not disclose any information about the Client without the Client’s written consent, and will not use the Client’s name as a reference without permission. Confidential information does not include information that:
* (a) was in the Coach’s possession before being provided by the Client;
* (b) is already public or generally known within the Client’s industry;
* (c) is obtained by the Coach from a third party without obligation to the Client;
* (d) is independently developed by the Coach without reference to the Client’s information; or
* (e) must be disclosed by law, court order, or subpoena.

Exceptions to confidentiality also apply where there is imminent risk of harm to the Client or others, or where illegal activity is disclosed.

In line with professional ethics, topics may be anonymously and hypothetically shared with other coaching professionals for training, supervision, mentoring, or professional development.

Personally identifiable data will only be used for invoicing and direct contact with the Client and will not be shared with third parties. Session notes and records will be retained securely for up to six months after the coaching relationship ends, unless otherwise agreed.

### Cancellation and lateness
The Client must notify the Coach by text or email at least 48 hours in advance if unable to attend a scheduled session. Sessions cancelled with less than 48 hours’ notice, or missed without notice, will be billed in full. The Coach will wait up to 10 minutes before recording the session as missed.

Exceptions may be made at the Coach’s discretion for circumstances outside the Client’s control. Sessions booked within 48 hours of their scheduled time remain payable if cancelled.

Session length will not be extended if the Client arrives late.

### Payment terms
Invoices will be issued by email after each session and are payable within 7 days via the payment methods specified on the invoice. A late payment charge of 10% of the outstanding balance will be applied to any invoice not settled within this period.

Where multiple sessions occur within the same month, fees may be grouped into a single invoice issued at month end.

### Refunds
Refunds are not available on a per-session basis since invoices are sent after sessions have completed and service has been delivered.

If a block of sessions (e.g. 3 sessions at a discounted rate) is booked, no refunds will be offered for unused sessions within that block. The discount is offered on the basis of the full block being completed.

### Termination
Either the Client or the Coach may terminate this agreement at any time.

The Coach also reserves the right to terminate services early in certain circumstances, such as illness, bereavement, other personal commitments, inappropriate behaviour by the Client, a conflict of interest, or other reasonable grounds. Where practicable, the Client will be given reasonable notice of such termination.

### Variation of terms and conditions
These terms and conditions may be updated by the Coach at any time. The current version will always be available on the Coach’s website and applies from the date of publication. It is the Client’s responsibility to review the terms periodically.

Material changes that affect commercial terms (including, without limitation, per-session fee, session duration, cancellation window, late-payment charges, refund rules, and block-booking terms) will be notified to the Client in writing (e.g. by email) and will only apply to sessions booked after the effective date stated in the notice. Sessions already booked (or paid) before that effective date will remain on the previous terms.

Failure to enforce any part of this agreement does not constitute a waiver of the right to enforce the same or any other part in future.

### Limited liability
Except as expressly provided in this agreement, the Coach makes no guarantees or warranties, express or implied. The Coach will not be liable for any indirect, consequential, or special damages.

The Client’s sole remedy for any claim under this agreement shall be limited to the total amount paid by the Client to the Coach for services delivered up to the date of termination.

### Governing law

This agreement is governed by the law of Scotland, and the Scottish courts have exclusive jurisdiction over any dispute, proceeding, or legal claim relating to the services provided or this contract.

This document constitutes the entire agreement between the parties and supersedes all prior written or oral representations regarding its subject matter.

### Feedback
Feedback about the service is welcomed and can be given during a coaching session or by emailing [coaching@outragedpinkracoon.com](coaching@outragedpinkracoon.com).
