I'm Valerie Dryden, a tech leader with 15 years of experience working in start-up and agency environments. As Director of Engineering at the Â£9m startups, Care Sourcer, I built and nurtured the engineering team during the pandemic; implementing the hiring, onboarding and personal development processes. I also architected systems, orchestrated projects and created technical product roadmaps. I'm just about to join Zego as Head of Engineering of a team of 100+ people.

I have over a decade of hands-on engineering experience, from building critical payments systems at scale with Deliveroo to client-facing software for companies including Skyscanner and Storm ID. I played a key role in establishing Scotland's first coding boot camp, building the instructional team and curriculum while teaching 100+ students how to code. I have also run workshops at Agile Scotland on effective collaborative working and given talks at Lead Dev Edinburgh and others.

You can find out more about me on my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/valeriejanedryden/). I offer tailored coaching and mentoring to a variety of people and businesses. If you need help setting up or nurturing your tech team or unlocking your potential, get in touch.
