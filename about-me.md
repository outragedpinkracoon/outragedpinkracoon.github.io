I'm Valerie Dryden, a tech leader and [qualified coach](https://outragedpinkracoon.com/coaching/) with 16 years of experience working in start-up and agency environments. I am Director of Engineering at appsec unicorn Snyk, responsible for multi-million projects spanning several squads. Previously I have been Head of Engineering at insuretech unicorn Zego, and Director of Engineering at tech startup Care Sourcer. I act as an executive coach to founders on the Barclays Eagle Labs and Codebase Techscaler programs.

I have over a decade of hands-on engineering experience, from building critical payments systems at scale with Deliveroo to client-facing software for companies including Skyscanner and Storm ID. I played a key role in establishing Scotland's first coding boot camp, building the instructional team and curriculum while teaching 100+ students how to code. I have also run workshops at Agile Scotland on effective collaborative working and given talks at Lead Dev Edinburgh and others.
