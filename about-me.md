# Hello!

I'm Valerie Dryden and I've been getting paid to develop software for the last 15 years. I've worked in start-ups setting up teams from scratch, agencies working on a wide variety of projects as well as working in scale-ups shipping extremely complex systems.

My passion lies with people. Hiring, coaching, mentoring, collaboration, culture, team dynamics, resourcing and everything in between. My goal is to spread as much joy at work as I possibly can, and unleash the potential of everyone on my team. I strongly believe building emotionally intelligent, collaborative teams is what will get our businesses to succeed and I have a track record of doing so.

You can find out more about me on my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/valeriejanedryden/). I offer tailored coaching and mentoring to a variety of people and businesses so drop me a line if you think I can help.

I have 2 really [chubster cats](https://www.instagram.com/outragedpinkracoon/).
