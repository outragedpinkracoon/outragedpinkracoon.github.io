I'm Valerie Dryden, a [Dare to Lead trained](https://daretolead.brenebrown.com/) tech leader with 15 years of experience working in start-up and agency environments. I currently work as Head of Engineering at £150m Series C funded insuretech unicorn Zego, responsible for multi-million projects spanning several squads, headcount planning and budgeting. As Director of Engineering at the £9m startup, Care Sourcer, I built and nurtured the engineering team during the pandemic; implementing the hiring, onboarding and personal development processes. I also architected systems, orchestrated projects and created technical product roadmaps.

I have over a decade of hands-on engineering experience, from building critical payments systems at scale with Deliveroo to client-facing software for companies including Skyscanner and Storm ID. I played a key role in establishing Scotland's first coding boot camp, building the instructional team and curriculum while teaching 100+ students how to code. I have also run workshops at Agile Scotland on effective collaborative working and given talks at Lead Dev Edinburgh and others.

I offer private remote coaching to individuals and companies - if you need help setting up or nurturing your tech team or unlocking your potential <a href="mailto:coaching@outragedpinkracoon.com?subject=Coaching Inquiry from Website">get in touch</a>. In the past I've helped with:
- Training those new to line management and leadership.
- Dealing with under-performing teams.
- Fixing a broken hiring/onboarding process.
- Dealing with interpersonal issues at work.

My tailored career coaching service for those working in tech allows them to have maximum business impact by discovering the clarity and purpose to perform at their best. This is bespoke to the individual but often covers:
- Identifying and overcoming potential obstacles to being at peak performance.
- Recognising, utilising and growing existing skills.
- Discovering growth areas for progression.
- Building a sense of grounded confidence with humility and openness.
- Exploration of personal values and how to use them to excel.
- Self-sponsorship techniques.
- Formulating a set of attainable goals and a plan of action for the short and long term.
- Developing emotional awareness and regulation.
- Overcoming the feeling of being ‘stuck’.
- Longer-term career trajectory planning.
