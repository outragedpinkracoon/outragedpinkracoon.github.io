# Hello!

I'm Valerie Dryden and I've been getting paid to write and help facilitate others to write software for the last 15 years. I've worked in startups setting up teams from scratch, agencies working on a wide variety of projects as well as working in scale ups shipping extremely complex systems.

My passion lies with people. Hiring, coaching, mentoring, collaboration, culture, team dynamics, resourcing and everything in between. My goal is to spread as much joy at work as I possible can, and unleash the potential of everyone on my team.

You can find out more about me on my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/valeriejanegibson/). Always open to chatting with interesting people so do drop me a line.

I have 2 really [chubster cats](https://www.instagram.com/outragedpinkracoon/).
