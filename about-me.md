Hi! I'm Val, I‚Äôm a choice-first work activist on a mission to grow a generation of tech leaders that don't suck. You can come chat to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/outragedpinkracoon/). I'm a tech leader and [qualified coach](https://outragedpinkracoon.com/coaching/) with 16 years of experience working in start-up and agency environments. I am VP of Engineering at Thirdfort, a ¬£10m ARR company on a mission to protect people from fraud.

I offer private, remote, [one-to-one coaching](http://outragedpinkracoon.com/coaching).

I also have a 5 ‚≠êÔ∏è online course, [Holy Shit I'm A Manager!](https://www.holyshitimamanager.com/course/engineering-manager-first-aid), provides the first aid Engineering Managers need to succeed in the role. Check it out in the link above üëÜ. 

Previously I was Director of Engineering at appsec unicorn Snyk, responsible for multi-million projects spanning several squads. I was also Head of Engineering at insuretech unicorn Zego, and Director of Engineering at tech startup Care Sourcer. I act as an executive coach to founders on the Barclays Eagle Labs and Codebase Techscaler programs.

I have over a decade of hands-on engineering experience, from building critical payments systems at scale with Deliveroo to client-facing software for companies including Skyscanner and Storm ID. I played a key role in establishing Scotland's first coding boot camp, building the instructional team and curriculum while teaching 100+ students how to code. I have also run workshops at Agile Scotland on effective pair programming and given talks at Lead Dev Edinburgh and others.
