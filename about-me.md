I'm Valerie Dryden, a tech leader with 15 years of experience working in start-up and agency environments. As Director of Engineering at the Â£9m startups, Care Sourcer, I built and nurtured the engineering team during the pandemic; implementing the hiring, onboarding and personal development processes. I also architected systems, orchestrated projects and created technical product roadmaps. I'm just about to join Zego as Head of Engineering of a team of 100+ people.

I have over a decade of hands-on engineering experience, from building critical payments systems at scale with Deliveroo to client-facing software for companies including Skyscanner and Storm ID. I played a key role in establishing Scotland's first coding boot camp, building the instructional team and curriculum while teaching 100+ students how to code. I have also run workshops at Agile Scotland on effective collaborative working and given talks at Lead Dev Edinburgh and others.

I offer private coaching to individuals and companies - if you need help setting up or nurturing your tech team or unlocking your potential <a href="mailto:coaching@outragedpinkracoon.com?subject=Coaching Inquiry from Website">get in touch</a>. In the past I've helped people with:
- Being a new line manager.
- Dealing with under performing teams.
- Fixing a broken hiring/onboarding process.
- Dealing with interpersonal issues at work.
- And many more...
