I'm Valerie Dryden, a [Dare to Lead trained](https://daretolead.brenebrown.com/) tech leader with 15 years of experience working in start-up and agency environments. I currently work as Head of Engineering at £150m Series C funded insuretech unicorn Zego, responsible for multi-million projects spanning several squads, headcount planning and budgeting. As Director of Engineering at the £9m startup, Care Sourcer, I built and nurtured the engineering team during the pandemic; implementing the hiring, onboarding and personal development processes. I also architected systems, orchestrated projects and created technical product roadmaps.

I have over a decade of hands-on engineering experience, from building critical payments systems at scale with Deliveroo to client-facing software for companies including Skyscanner and Storm ID. I played a key role in establishing Scotland's first coding boot camp, building the instructional team and curriculum while teaching 100+ students how to code. I have also run workshops at Agile Scotland on effective collaborative working and given talks at Lead Dev Edinburgh and others.
