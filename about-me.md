Hello! I'm Valerie Dryden and I've been getting paid to develop software for the last 15 years. My passion lies with people: leadership, hiring, coaching, mentoring, collaboration, project delivery, culture, onboarding, team dynamics, resourcing and everything in between. My goal is to spread as much joy at work as I possibly can and unleash the potential of everyone on my team, including myself!

I strongly believe building emotionally intelligent, collaborative teams is what will get our businesses to succeed and I have a track record of doing so. I've worked in start-ups setting up teams from scratch, agencies working on a wide variety of projects as well as working in scale-ups shipping extremely complex systems.

You can find out more about me on my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/valeriejanedryden/). I offer tailored coaching and mentoring to a variety of people and businesses so drop me a line if you think I can help.

I have 2 really [chubster cats](https://www.instagram.com/outragedpinkracoon/).
