If you are not a leader whose default stance is to ask lots of great questions of your team, grab a copy of Leading With Questions and it might just transform you and your company. If you are a leader that asks questions and haven't read The Coaching Habit then go buy a copy just now and enjoy the joyful adventure of reading it and discovering new questions to use every day.

This is a list of my favourite questions that I'll be adding to as I uncover more from books and my day to day. I like to choose a few each day to see if I can work them in to help me practise - it's surprisingly hard to ask the right question, at the right time to the right person but when you get it right it unlocks doors and ways of thinking you didn't even know were possible.
