Many companies use a 'pairing' step in interviews, so let's have a look at some of the perils of using pairing in interviews and how we can address them to set the candidate up for success.

## Peril 1: The Power Dynamic Is Totally Off
There is often an all too common situation where a junior dev is interviewed by a staff engineer and a principal or a mid level engineer is interviewed by a CTO and a senior developer. Immediately the candidate is in a very vulnerable situation where the interviewer is very unlikely to be able to empathise with their situation at all and be an intimidating presence - worse if the interviewers are not even the same race or gender as the candidate.

If we want people to feel at ease, we need to get people to interview them that can have the best chance at putting them at ease and making them feel supported and that we want them to succeed. If you can't see the world from the same or similar view as the person, you probably shouldn't be pairing with them - try to stick to one pay grade above or below.

Send out information about _who_ will be on the call in advance so the candidate isn't caught off guard.

## Peril 2: Pairing Isn't Staring!
Pairing by it's very definition is meant to solve a problem of working in isolation on a problem. But many pairing interviews involve the candidate being stared at by multiple people while they get given orders to do. This isn't _at all_ in the spirit of pairing. Interviews are nerve wracking enough - I've been doing this a long time and the minute someone watches me type even in a non interview situation I start making all sorts of mistakes. A pairing interview should give the candidate a flavour of what it's like to work at a company with the other engineers.

If the interview is online there are plenty tools now like Visual Studio Code Live Share or Code With Me by JetBrains which make the pairing sessions seamless and collaborative.

## Peril 3: No Information About Setup
If the candidate needs to have certain things installed on their machines, tell them in advance and ideally give them a sample bit of code to run to ensure everything is working okay in advance. It's a sure fire road to disaster if a candidate's first experience on the call is realised xcode tools aren't working and now they can't use git, or they have the wrong version of Node installed and so on. Set them up for success with clear environment setup guidelines.

## Peril 3: Very Unclear Success Criteria
A lot of the time the candidate is sent an invite to a pairing interview with little to no explanation of what will be expected. Worse, a lot of the time interviewers have no common framework to work to in deciding if a candidate has passed or not. Be clear on expectations and send them out in advance to the candidate and think about:

- Is it okay to google?
- Can they ask the interviewers questions?
- Is it more important to 'finish the task' or to ask good questions?
- What does success look like? What does not succeeding look like?
- Are there specific behaviours you are looking for?
- Is the code to be written in a specific style?

Pairing is so, so intricate and difficult even in a normal working environment and being unclear on expectations is a sure fire way to cost the business great people.

## Peril 4: Failing People For Not Knowing 'Basic' Syntax
The amount of times I've seen amazing engineers fail interviews because in the heat of the moment their minds go blank and they can't remember something. It happens to _everyone_ and is not a valid reason to fail someone. If it's a _pairing_ exercise, the partner should be there to help them out and ease the pressure and let them collect themselves. Not go silent or worse, berate them on the call and make them feel small.

This is the trouble with pairing at all in interviews. It's a very artificial environment where the candidate is _really_ vulnerable and it takes _so much_ skill from the interviewers to keep them calm and get the best out of them.

If candidates are failing for not knowing 'basic syntax' but have a track record of high performance in other jobs, it's time to look at if the 'pairing' step is actually serving you and the candidates at all or if something else would be more suitable.

## Peril 5: There Is No Pairing In The Day to Day
Using a pairing step in an interview when the culture of the team doesn't involve pairing is problematic for a number of reasons.

1. It gives the candidate the wrong impression and they might want to work somewhere that supports pairing.
2. The interviewers have no empathy for how difficult it is to pair and get the best out of each other even in a less stressful situation outside of interview.
3. The interviewers may be unskilled at pairing and give the candidate a very bad experience which reflects badly on the company and may cost them talent.
3. The interview isn't assessing for the actual skills and behaviours the team are employing during the working day.

In this situation it's definitely better to bin the 'pairing' step and find a more suitable method to use that assesses for the skills and behaviours the team is looking for.
