## Problem 1: Barriers to Information

You see a job ad and it looks great. The tech stack is a perfect fit, the product is interesting and the culture seems ideal. You apply only to find out there's a 5 stage interview process:

1. Initial Chat with internal recruiter 45 mins
2. Technical coding challenge 2 hours
3. Technical pairing session 2 hours
4. Values and culture interview 1 hour
5. CTO interview 1 hour

That's theoretically 6 hours and 45 mins, and you have to spend:
- 4 hours 45 mins before you even get to really dig into the culture and values to see if you really like it there.
- 5 hours 45 mins before you get to learn more about the engineering team and who you would be working with.

This isn't even close to the worst I've seen, many companies have processes that can take a month or more, with 10+ steps in the process.

That's a LOT of time for folks that have free time let alone anyone with care responsibilities, a second job or anything else going on in their hectic adult lives.

### Try Instead

Reduce the amount of time in the interview process to the bare minimum you need to do to find out if someone is going to be a good fit. No amount of process is ever going to be a substitute for the new hires first few weeks in the door when you will get to know the real person and by putting up barriers you're going to turn away those with time commitment issues.

## Problem 2: 2 hours is NEVER 2 hours.

There's also the problem that the 2 hour coding test is NEVER 2 hours... never. I've done a LOT of code tests in my time and by the time you set up tests, the linter and everything else it's easily half a day for most tasks. Let me give you an example from my recent job searches:

- Ruby coding challenge in 2 parts, 2 hours recommended time. Took around 8 hours.
- Rails api challenge, 3 hours recommended time. Took around 12 hours.
- Rails full stack challenge, 2 hours recommended time. Took around 10 hours.
