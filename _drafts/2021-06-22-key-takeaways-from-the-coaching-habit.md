If you've not read [The Coaching Habit](https://boxofcrayons.com/the-coaching-habit-book/) go buy it now and enjoy having more meaningful and productive conversations in your work and personal lives. It's great and it's a joyful book to read in a chunky font and a playful tone, I love it.

You’ve spent years delivering advice and getting promoted and praised for it. You’re seen to be “adding value” and you’ve the added bonus of staying in control of the situation. On the other hand, when you’re asking questions, you might feel less certain about whether you’re being useful, the conversation can feel slower and you might feel like you’ve somewhat lost control of the conversation (and indeed you have. That’s called “empowering”).

We can create over-dependence because the more we help people, the more they seem to need our help. Building a coaching habit can help us break out of this cycle by creating autonomy and a sense of mastery in the people we help.

Ask one question at a time. Just one question at a time.

'If you know what question to ask, get to the point and ask it. Then stay quiet and listen to the answer.

## 1. The Kickstart Question

'What's on your mind?'

The question gets a conversation happening 'fast and deep'. In one to ones it avoids small talk, dreary repetitive meetings no one gets anything out of and avoids going straight into 'diagnose a (may or may not be real) problem' mode.

Because it’s open, it invites people to get to the heart of the matter and share what’s most important to them. You’re not telling them or guiding them. You’re showing them the trust and granting them the autonomy to make the choice for themselves. And yet the question is focused, too. It’s not an invitation to tell you anything or everything.

From here we can let the person choose which of the 3Ps we can choose to focus on to start with:
- Project - any challenges around the actual content
- People - any issues with team members/colleagues/other departments/bosses/customers/clients
- Patterns - if there’s a way that you’re getting in your own way, and not showing up in the best possible way.

We are what we give our attention to' and 'what you’re holding in your mind will unconsciously influence what you can notice and focus on'. 'Asking the Kickstart Question works as a little pressure-release valve and helps make explicit something that might be unduly influencing the way you work.

## The AWE Question

'And what else?'

There are three reasons it has the impact that it does: more options can lead to better decisions; you rein yourself in; and you buy yourself time.

The first answer someone gives you is almost never the only answer, and it’s rarely the best answer. The AWE question leads to more options and often better ones. Better options -> better decisions -> greater success.

As a general rule as it a little more than less, maybe up to 3 times in a given conversation. When someone says 'There is nothing else' then that's a great success and try not to panic.

'Is there anything else?' is a great wrap-up version of this question.
